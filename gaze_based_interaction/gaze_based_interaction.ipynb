    "## Gaze-based interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Andrew Howes\n",
    "\n",
    "June 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaze-based interaction is the problem of selecting items presented on a computer with eye movements and fixations. The problem for the computer is to determine when a user's fixation represents the intention to select. The problem for the user is to make efficient eye movements towards an intended target and to hold fixation on the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaze-based interaction has been studied in human-computer interaction (HCI) since the 1990s and interest has been maintained throughout the intervening years. Recent technological advances, such as the addition of eye tracking capabilities to virtual reality and augmented reality (AR), have sparked another wave of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that gaze-based interaction is interesting is that eye-movements are highly strategic. For example, eye-movements tend to undershoot a target, presumably because, in the presence of uncertainty, undershooting costs less time than overshooting. Another interesting property of eye-movements to a target is that they obey Fitts's Law; that is the movement time of the eyes is proportional to the distance and inversely proportional to the size of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to introduce a reinforcement learning model of how human's select a target by moving their eyes to it. The model is a version of that presented in Chen et al. (2021) that has been restructured for tutorial purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than strategies being programmed into the model, instead a policy for how to move the eyes is learned using reinforcement learning. The learned policy is the optimal solution to a problem that is defined by the constraints imposed by the oculomotor and perceptual systems. These constraints include the fact that eye-movements, fixations and visual perception are stochastic. Eye-movements for example, do not go exactly where cognition intends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints are defined in a cognitive architecture -- an information processing model of the mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The cognitive architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image/architecture.png\" alt=\"Box diagram of a cognitive model.\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A cognitive architecture represents a commitment to a theory of how information is processed in the human mind. The cognitive architecture in the figure consists of five modules (inside the dashed box) that interact with an external world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, the modules have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **World** On each trial, a circular target with a diameter \"width\" and a location (x,y) appears in the World. Target locations are randomly sampled from a bivariate Gaussian distribution centred at (0,0).\n",
    "* **Perception** The location of target location stimuli are corrupted by Gaussian noise in human vision. The standard deviation of noise increases linearly with eccentricity from the fovea. \n",
    "* **Memory** Sequences of stimuli are optimally integrated.\n",
    "* **Utility** Rewards are received for getting closer to the target.\n",
    "* **Motor** Intended eye movements (oculomotor actions) are corrupted by signal dependent Gaussian noise to generate responses.\n",
    "* **Control**  The Control module observes the memory and receives a reward. It learns a policy for making eye movements to the target that maximises the reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "A python implementation of each module is described below.\n",
    "\n"
